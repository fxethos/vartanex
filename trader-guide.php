            <h2 class="title iq-tw-6">Interpreting the Order Book </h2>
        </div>
    </div>
   
     <div class="col-lg-12">
   <p style="color:#333; text-align:justify">We, at VartanEx, believe in transparency and we want our traders to understand exactly what they are signing up for. We are firm proponents of 'What You See Is What You Get', and it's best for a trader to know how much volume is waiting for them at their desired price before they even place the order, so here we are with an open order book.</p>
   
   <h5 class="tt-green-head">What is an order book?</h5>
   
   <p style="text-align:justify; color:#333">An order book is a ledger that contains information of all standing orders -instructions from traders to buy or sell bitcoin or any other form of cryptocurrency. An order to buy is called a 'buy order' (which interested sellers would be looking at) and an order to sell is known as a 'sell order' (which interested buyers would be looking at). </p>
   
   <h5 class="tt-green-head">How to interpret an order book?</h5>
   
   <p style="color:#333; text-align:justify">To understand how to interpret order books, one needs to know that a person cannot buy/sell unlimited volume of cryptocurrency at a given price. Because in order for a person to sell a bitcoin, there has to be a buyer, and each buyer/seller will have their own price in mind. This means that there is always limited demand for a cryptocurrency at a given price.</p>
   
   <p style="text-align:justify; color:#333">For instance, take a look at the order book given below.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify; color:#333">This order book includes two separate tables for buy orders and sell order. For both sides of the orders, the annotated numbers indicate the following:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-1" style="margin:10px 0 15px">
    <li>The price level</li>
	<li>The total volume of Ethereum (or any other cryptocurrency) in the order book at that price level</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:#333">So, if you're a buyer, you would be looking at the "Sell Orders" table and see how much volume is waiting to be sold to you at your desired price. Same way, if you're a seller, you would be looking at the "Buy Orders" table and see how much volume people are ready to buy at your price.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:#333; margin-bottom:25px">The third table, Trade History, lists the recently completed orders with the volume of the order against the respective price.</p>

   	<h5 class="tt-green-head">What is a limit order?</h5>
    <p  style="text-align:justify; color:#333">A limit order is a smart trade move in the field of cryptocurrency. When you buy/sell at a limit price, you are responsible for selling at the price you want. The order is executed only when a buyer wants your cryptocurrency at your price.</p>
   </div>
   
   <div class="col-lg-6">
   	<h5 class="tt-green-head">What are buy and sell orders?</h5>
   <p  style="text-align:justify; color:#333">If an order is placed to the order book to buy bitcoins, ethereum, ripple, litecoin, or bitcoin cash with INR, it is a buy order. On the other hand, if an order placed to the order book to sell bitcoin or other forms of cryptocurrencies, it is known as sell order.</p>
   </div>
   
    <div class="col-lg-12">
   <h5 class="tt-green-head">How are orders posted on the order book? How are buy and sell orders matched?</h5>
   
   <p style="text-align:justify; color:#333">An order is automatically posted to the order book as soon as it is placed. Orders are matched on the order book through order priority and matching engine. In simple terms it means that every time there is an order (O) is placed, there is counter order P on the order book that fulfills the full or semi criteria of the original order. It also means O can be matched with a consequent order at either the same price per unit or a better price per unit. </p>

     <h5 class="tt-green-head">What are the trading fees and how do they work? </h5>
     <p>At VartanEx, we do not wish to impose too much on our valued traders. A nominal trading fee (0.15%) will be charged on every transaction. If a user trades INR in one's account for bitcoin, he/she has to pay. Luckily, our exchange also offers a fee rebate. The higher number of intra-day traders will get fee rebate in the trading fee depending on their trading volume for the day. For instance, if a trader sells trade volume ranging from Rs 2,50,000 to Rs 5,00,000, the seller gets 100% fee rebate and the buyer gets 10% fee rebate.</p>
