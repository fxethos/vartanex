        <p class="tt">With VartanEx, you're dealing with ethereum, which is secure and robust. But it is crucial to practice ways to keep yourself safe from phishing and other attacks. Here are some easy steps you can take to keep your ether and your VartanEx account safe. </p>
        <!--<p class="tt"><img src="images/thumbs.png" alt="img"/> <span>Save your 12-word recovery seed safely. Preferably, write it down on a piece of paper and lock it away in a locker.  <br>This seed in wrong hands can be used to gain control of your ether holdings. </span></p>-->
        <p class="tt"><img src="images/thumbs.png" alt="img"/> <span>Make sure you download the VartanEx app only from App Store and Google Play Store. Not from any other source.</span> </p>
        <p class="tt"><img src="images/thumbs.png" alt="img"/> <span>Use a complex alpha-numeric password for Vartnex that is not common with other accounts like Facebook and Gmail. </span></p>
        <p class="tt"><img src="images/thumbs.png" alt="img"/> <span>VartanEx will never ask you for your password or two-factor pin. Never give it out to anyone. </span></p>
        <p class="tt"><img src="images/thumbs.png" alt="img"/> <span>For any news and changes with VartanEx, only follow official channels. </span></p>
        <p class="tt"><img src="images/thumbs.png" alt="img"/> <span>Make sure the email you receive comes from <a href="mailto:hello@vartanex.in" style="color:#1c947f ">hello@vartanex.in</a> and not from any other source.</span> </p>
