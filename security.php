        <p class="tt">At VartanEx we strive to provide transparency. We do not set fixed buy and sell rates for everyone to follow. Instead, we provide a transparent order book where all buy and sell orders placed by others is visible. Along with that, all the previous orders which were executed are visible. Users can choose to use these rates and trade ether. </p>

        <p class="tt">VartanEx is app-only so that it is easier for our users to trade from anywhere and at the same time, stay secure. Make sure you download our app only from App Store or Play Store, and not from any third party services. </p>

        <h3 class="sm-green-head"><img src="images/ether.jpg" alt="img"/> All Ether stored locally  </h3>
        <p class="tt">A new ether wallet is created on your phone once you create your account and sign in. This wallet is stored locally, and all your ether is stored here instead of our servers. The ether is transferred back to us only when you want to sell it in the market. This way, you control your keys, and you are responsible for your ether. </p>

        <p class="tt">In addition to your password, two-factor authentication is enabled by default for VartanEx users. An SMS will be sent to the registered mobile number every time users log in or withdraw money. This is done to ensure the security of our users. Additionally, users have a choice of using Google Authenticator instead of our SMS two-factor authentication if they choose to. </p>

        <p class="tt">If we recognise your account being logged in from a new device, in addition to the two-factor authentication, users will have to enter another code sent to their email address. This is done to ensure an extra layer of security for our users. </p>

        <p class="tt">While the ethereum wallet is created on your phone, a random 12-word recovery seed is generated. In case you lose your phone and your ethereum wallet with ether in it, you'll be able to use the recovery seed on any third party ethereum wallet to recover your ether.  </p>
